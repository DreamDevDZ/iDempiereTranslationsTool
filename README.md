# iDempiereTranslationsTool
I decided to create an Info Window to display all translations in one place in order to not lose context in which the words are used. The window can display words from all translation tables, filter them and it supports ZOOM (after you select a record in a subwindow). Moreover, there's a button to open a pop-up window which sets tables and columns that are viewed in the info window.
